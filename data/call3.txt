CSR:Good evening, thank you for calling [Logistics Company Name], this is Maya, how can I assist you?Customer:Hello, I’m calling about my parcel that hasn’t been delivered yet. I was expecting it to arrive three days ago, and I’m starting to get really worried. Can you check the status for me?CSR:I’m really sorry for the delay, and I completely understand your concern. I’d be happy to help. Could you please provide me with your tracking number?Customer:Sure, it’s CD6543219870.CSR:Thank you. Please hold for just a moment while I check on the status of your parcel… (pause)I can see that your parcel was due for delivery a few days ago, but it’s currently on hold due to missing customs documentation. It appears there was an issue with the paperwork that was required for international shipping.Customer:What do you mean by "missing documentation"? I gave all the necessary details when I sent it. This is really frustrating.CSR:I completely understand how frustrating this must be. It looks like the customs team flagged an issue with the paperwork on our side, which delayed the shipment. It was just a minor issue, and we are working quickly to get the missing documentation processed.Customer:But why wasn’t I told about this earlier? If I knew there was a paperwork problem, I could’ve taken care of it myself.CSR:You’re absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for not notifying you sooner. This should have been communicated, and I’m really sorry for the inconvenience. I’ve escalated the issue to our customs department, and we’re expediting the process. Your parcel is now set to be released and should be delivered by the end of tomorrow.Customer:End of tomorrow? It’s so late, but I guess it’s better than nothing. Is there a way to make sure this doesn’t happen again?CSR:I completely understand how important it is for you to receive your parcel as planned, and I will ensure that this issue is addressed. I’ve taken steps to make sure the documentation is now complete, and I’ll personally keep track of your parcel’s progress to ensure there are no more delays.Customer:Okay, I really hope it comes tomorrow as you said. Thanks for helping to sort it out.CSR:You’re welcome. I’m sorry again for the inconvenience, and I’ll send you an email with the updated tracking information. If anything else comes up, please feel free to reach out.Customer:I will. Thanks again, Maya.CSR:My pleasure. Take care, and I’ll make sure your parcel arrives as promised tomorrow.Customer:Thanks. Goodbye.CSR:Goodbye!
